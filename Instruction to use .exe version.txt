Welcome To DEEP LEARNING BASED COLORIZATION FOR VISUAL MEDIA
----------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains:
1- .exe app to run and test the project.( please read full instructions to run successfully ).
2- Folder contains the source code of the project.
---------------------------------------------------

1.1 - Instructions to run the .exe
--------------------------------------
1- Choose a landscape (barks, gardens,..) images for testing because our model is trained over 
   a landscape dataset only.

2- You’ll never be required to setup any programs, environments, python setup scripts or libraries,
   just follow next instructions.
 
 1- Move the Colorization Model folder to 'C:' Drive.
 2- Put the Greyscale image in the Colorization Model folder.
 3- Open ColorizationModel.exe.
 4- the .exe will require the name of the greyscale image name(don't forget to add image extension)[example gry_image.png].
 5- the .exe will load the image and colorize it.
 6- the result (colored image) will be saved at the same folder of .exe and it's name will be the same name of gray image plus "_Colored".
